Getting Started
---------------
To get up and running, simply do the following:

    $ git clone git@github.com:shubham2637/vymo.git
    $ cd vymo

    # Install the requirements
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt



    # Perform database migrations if required
    $ python manage.py makemigrations
    $ python manage.py migrate
    
    # Start the server
    $ python manage.py runserver

**NOTE**: I highly recommend creating a [Virtual Environment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/). Python Virtual Environments allow developers to work in isolated sandboxes and to create separation between python packages installed via [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip).
